\section*{Enhanced Resume}

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this resume enhancement. The job description is for a frontend role focusing on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. The resume has some relevant experience but needs to highlight those key areas more.

First, I'll look at the resume's current content. Ritesh has experience with React in projects like MovieDex and RBAC System. He mentions ReactJs and Tailwind CSS, which are good. But the job description emphasizes responsive design and cross-browser compatibility. His resume does mention responsive interfaces, but maybe he can expand on that.

Matching keywords: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, RESTful APIs, responsive design. He has these, but they might be buried. The job also wants problem-solving and teamwork, which are in his experience but could be more explicit.

Recommendations: Maybe reorder skills to put frontend tech first. Add more details on cross-browser testing or specific responsive projects. Highlight collaboration with designers, which is in the job description. His current experience talks about backend integrations; perhaps downplay that and focus more on frontend tasks. Also, certifications in React or frontend could be beneficial, but he has Udemy certs already. Maybe mention staying updated with trends, which the job wants.
